                        On Sunday 12 May 2013, a weekly market returned to the Market Place in Brentford, West London. Focusing on high quality food the market offers local people an alternative to the supermarket and a chance to purchase locally sourced, affordable produce.  The market also aims to provide Brentford with a much needed community space where people can meet for a coffee or share some street food.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Rosie Boycott, Chair of the London Food Board said: "I am delighted that this market has returned to Brentford. As with so many of our High Streets, Brentford no longer has a butcher, fishmonger or green grocer and I think it is vital that Londoners have access to good, affordable, high quality food. Brentford market will also provide a valuable space for people to get together, to meet each other and support community projects and local businesses."
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The brain child of local regeneration charity Brentford High Street Steering Group (BHSSG), the market was relaunched and operated on a not-for-profit basis by the charity offering local businesses, traders and community groups affordable pitches from 2013 through to Nov 2018,  when Marsh Farm (one of the traders) took over the operating license with LB Hounslow.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Jo Scully, Trustee of the BHSSG said: “We’ve seen how markets, especially food markets, can revitalise high streets. We have the backing of Hounslow Council, local councillors, our MP and most importantly local residents, who are really excited about a weekly market in the heart of the town centre.”
